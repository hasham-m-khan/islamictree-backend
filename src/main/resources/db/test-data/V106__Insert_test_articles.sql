    'The Expanse: Leviathan Wakes',
    'From a New York Times best-selling and Hugo award-winning author comes a modern masterwork of science fiction, introducing a captain, his crew, and a detective as they unravel a horrifying solar system wide conspiracy that begins with a single missing girl.',
    '<p>A hundred and fifty years before, when the parochial disagreements between Earth and Mars had been on the verge of war, the Belt had been a far horizon of tremendous mineral wealth beyond viable economic reach, and the outer planets had been beyond even the most unrealistic corporate dream. Then Solomon Epstein had built his little modified fusion drive, popped it on the back of his three-man yacht, and turned it on. With a good scope, you could still see his ship going at a marginal percentage of the speed of light, heading out into the big empty. The best, longest funeral in the history of mankind. Fortunately, he’d left the plans on his home computer. The Epstein Drive hadn’t given humanity the stars, but it had delivered the planets.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of a kilometer long, a quarter of a kilometer wide—roughly shaped like a fire hydrant—and mostly empty space inside, the Canterbury was a retooled colony transport. Once, it had been packed with people, supplies, schematics, machines, environment bubbles, and hope. Just under twenty million people lived on the moons of Saturn now. The Canterbury had hauled nearly a million of their ancestors there. Forty-five million on the moons of Jupiter. One moon of Uranus sported five thousand, the farthest outpost of human civilization, at least until the Mormons finished their generation ship and headed for the stars and freedom from procreation restrictions.</p>
<p>And then there was the Belt.</p>
<p>If you asked OPA recruiters when they were drunk and feeling expansive, they might say there were a hundred million in the Belt. Ask an inner planet census taker, it was nearer to fifty million. Anyway you looked, the population was huge and needed a lot of water.</p>
<p>So now the Canterbury and her dozens of sister ships in the Pur\’n\’Kleen Water Company made the loop from Saturn’s generous rings to the Belt and back hauling glaciers, and would until the ships aged into salvage wrecks.</p>
<p>Jim Holden saw some poetry in that.<br></p>
<q>Holden?</q>
<p>He turned back to the hangar deck. Chief Engineer Naomi Nagata towered over him. She stood almost two full meters tall, her mop of curly hair tied back into a black tail, her expression halfway between amusement and annoyance. She had the Belter habit of shrugging with her hands instead of her shoulders.</p>
<p><q>Holden, are you listening, or just staring out the window?</q><br>
<q>There was a problem,</q> Holden said. <q>And because you’re really, really good, you can fix it even though you don’t have enough money or supplies.</q></p>
<p>Naomi laughed.<br>
<q>So you weren’t listening,</q> she said.<br>
<q>Not really, no.</q><br>
<q>Well, you got the basics right anyhow. Knight\’s landing gear isn\’t going to be good in atmosphere until I can get the seals replaced. That going to be a problem?</q><br>
<q>I’ll ask the old man,</q> Holden said. <q>But when’s the last time we used the shuttle in atmosphere?</q><br>
<q>Never, but regs say we need at least one atmo-capable shuttle.</q></p>
<p><q>Hey, Boss!</q> Amos Burton, Naomi’s earthborn assistant, yelled from across the bay. He waved one meaty arm in their general direction. He meant Naomi. Amos might be on Captain McDowell’s ship; Holden might be executive officer; but in Amos Burton’s world, only Naomi was boss.</p>',
